					Etienne van Wyk immigrated to the United States in 1996 with his family. He is a co-founder and instructor with River City Dance Club. He has lived in Chattanooga since 2004 when he also started dancing. Etienne got his first taste of dancing at Shirley's, a local square dance/swing dance venue, where he learned "street swing" and asked anyone who knew more than he did for advice. He frequently attended dance events at Shirley's for several years. After dancing ballroom for years after, Etienne found the Vintage Swing Dance culture in Nashville in 2011 and hasn't stopped enjoying it since.

					Lindsey Miller grew up in Chattanooga and is a co-founder of River City Dance Club. Her dance career began at the Chattanooga Theater Center where she took East Coast Swing dance lessons as a teenager. Some of her first performances included the Grande Illumination at Coolidge Park which featured swing routines set to Christmas music. In college, Lindsey learned how to Lindy Hop and continued with that vintage style ever since. She was also introduced to West Coast swing dance in Murfreesboro and developed her passion for the dance in Huntsville. Lindsey is passionate about all forms of swing dance and constantly seeks to improve her skill level by attending workshops and dance exchanges.
